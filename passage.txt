If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
    If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
    And treat those two impostors just the same...
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
    With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth...
